		<p class="content_desc">This is my website. Here I put some cool <a onclick="open_menu()">things</a> I'm working on, some boring stuff, and some other stuff I haven't thought of yet. The purpose of this site is to become a portfolio of my work, and also to get me focused on a project long enough for it to make it here. I also have a few projects that are on going which will pop up here ever so often.</p>

		<h1 class="content_header">About Me</h1>
		<p class="content_desc">Hello, I'm ConsumerJunk, a wannabe application developer and an upper-end mediocre programmer. I've been programming since I was 10 or so when it started as a hobby with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_target">Scratch</a>. But as my desire to want to do more complicated things grew, so did my knowledge of other programming languages. After a short stint with QBasic (I had a programming book about the language that was surprisingly popular at my school) I moved on to C#. I really liked C#, but found that I couldn't quite do what I wanted with it. The language itself was fine, but I never was fond of the way the code looked, and while there are plenty of YouTube videos on it, almost all of them don't know how to properly place their brackets. After my initial experience with these unsuitable languages (Except scratch, that'll always be my first) I found what really mattered in life. Not family, friends, money or even coffee. The real thing you can look forward to in life is the moment you discover Java. </p>
